Network Design Objectives & Subnetting

Here's a breakdown of your network design, including correct subnetting and connectivity requirements.
Subnetting the 192.168.40.0 Network

To meet the requirement of having at least two departments (ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY), we'll create two subnets from the given 192.168.40.0/24 network. This requires borrowing 1 bit from the host portion of the IP address, resulting in a new subnet mask of 255.255.255.128 (or /25).

Each subnet will have 126 usable host IP addresses (27âˆ’2=126), which is ample for the department requirements.
Subnet 1: ACCOUNTS Department

    Network ID: 192.168.40.0/25
    Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.128
    Usable Host IP Range: 192.168.40.1 to 192.168.40.126
    Broadcast ID: 192.168.40.127

Subnet 2: DELIVERY Department

    Network ID: 192.168.40.128/25
    Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.128
    Usable Host IP Range: 192.168.40.129 to 192.168.40.254
    Broadcast ID: 192.168.40.255

Network Implementation Details
1. Departmental PC Requirements

    ACCOUNTS Department: Two or more PCs will be assigned IP addresses from the 192.168.40.1 to 192.168.40.126 range.
    DELIVERY Department: Two or more PCs will be assigned IP addresses from the 192.168.40.129 to 192.168.40.254 range.

2. Network Hardware

    Switches: One network switch per department is needed to connect the PCs within each department. A 24-port Fast Ethernet switch should be sufficient for most small to medium-sized departments.
    Router: A single router is essential to connect the two distinct subnets (ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY). This router will facilitate communication between the departments.

3. IP Address Configuration

Here's an example of how devices should be configured:

    Router Configuration:
        Interface for ACCOUNTS (e.g., G0/0):
            IP Address: 192.168.40.1 (This will be the default gateway for ACCOUNTS PCs)
            Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.128
        Interface for DELIVERY (e.g., G0/1):
            IP Address: 192.168.40.129 (This will be the default gateway for DELIVERY PCs)
            Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.128

    ACCOUNTS Department PCs (Example: PC-ACC-01, PC-ACC-02):
        PC-ACC-01:
            IP Address: 192.168.40.2
            Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.128
            Default Gateway: 192.168.40.1
        PC-ACC-02:
            IP Address: 192.168.40.3
            Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.128
            Default Gateway: 192.168.40.1

    DELIVERY Department PCs (Example: PC-DEL-01, PC-DEL-02):
        PC-DEL-01:
            IP Address: 192.168.40.130
            Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.128
            Default Gateway: 192.168.40.129
        PC-DEL-02:
            IP Address: 192.168.40.131
            Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.128
            Default Gateway: 192.168.40.129

4. Cabling

    PCs to Switches: Use straight-through Ethernet cables.
    Switches to Router: Use straight-through Ethernet cables.

5. Connectivity Testing

To confirm inter-departmental communication:

    From any PC in the DELIVERY department (e.g., 192.168.40.130), open the command prompt or terminal.
    Ping a PC in the ACCOUNTS department (e.g., 192.168.40.2) using the command: ping 192.168.40.2.

A successful ping indicates that the router is correctly routing traffic between the two subnets, and all configurations are accurate.

## About Packet Tracer

[Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) is a powerful network simulation tool provided by Cisco Systems. It allows users to create, configure, and troubleshoot network topologies using a wide range of virtual network devices such as routers, switches, end devices (PCs, servers, IoT devices), and wireless access points. It's an excellent resource for students and professionals to practice networking skills in a safe, virtual environment.
